            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>The computer mouse is a device that allows us to communicate with computer equipment, moving a cursor on the screen to point and click, it is a device that is usually connected by USB, although formerly it was connected to the PS / 2 port. <br> It is a lot more important than I think because it has allowed people who are not very computer literate and could not have been able to communicate with a computer with a keyboard and commands to use these tools. <br> What has increased the demand for equipment and therefore the investment of money and the increase in innovation. So thanks to the mouse today the world is what it is.</p>

                <h2>Past:</h2>
                <div class="half" class="left">
                    <p>The first mouse as we know it was designed during the 1960s (1963). It was an invention co-designed by two men, Bill English (right) and Douglas Engelbart (left).</p>
                    <p>This device had the appearance of a wooden paving stone and worked thanks to two metal wheels that established the X and Y axes.</p>
                    <p>It also had a red button at the top.</p>
                    <p>Although it seems very archaic, the logic behind the device is not very different from current mouse.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="half" class="left">
                    <p>In 1981 the first PC with a built-in mouse appeared (Xerox star 8010 | right), it also included a graphical user interface</p>
                    <p>Although it already existed, it was with the Mac 1984 that this tool really became popular (left image)</p>

                <div class="half" class="left">
                    <p>The first commercial mouse were mechanical, that is, they used a plastic ball that moves two wheels, similar to those of the 1963 protocol.</p>
                    <p>Some time later, in 1999, the first optical mouse came out, the Microsoft Intellimouse Intellieye.</p>

                    <p>Currently the market is focused on "gaming" mouse, dedicated to video games, since this is where a very precise and comfortable pointer is required for competitive games.</p>
                    <p>These have many buttons to allow assigning controls to them, for example for reloading in a shooter video game.<p>
                    <p>Extremely precise and fluid movement has already been achieved in these peripherals and it is difficult to glimpse their future.</p>

                    <p>The mouse models that we know are already highly evolved (polling rate, DPI ...) but new very interesting models are appearing. </p>
                    <p>An example of these are the new devices that allow us to interact in <b>virtual reality</b> environments. Since in these we cannot make use of current devices.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that these devices would not be mouse as such, they would be more like nice substitutes in VR environments.</p>
                    <p>It is also important to know that these new controllers are at a very early stage, and it is expected that in a few years this technology will be more established, for gaming and even professional functions (architecture, industrial design...).</p>

                    <p> For this you will have to take into account the shape of the mouse and your type of grip, there are 3 types: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Palm: You need a mouse with an inclined curvature to the side with which you are going to hold the mouse. </li>
                        <li> Claw: They are usually elongated and fully centered mouse. </li>
                        <li> Fingers: They are usually smaller mouse with a more round shape, also centered. </li>

                    <p> It is important to take into account what is mentioned in the mouse types section: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> We will have to know if we want a wired or wireless one </li>
                        <li> It is important to know where we will use it to choose between laser (glass table) and infrared (mat or cloth). </li>
                        <li> It is important to know if we want an ergonomic or left-handed one. </li>

                    <p> The quality. </p>
                    <p> It is important to take into account the quality of the product: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> We must ensure that it is made of materials that will not spoil in a short time. </li>
                        <li> We can look at the mouse brand to see if it is of good quality (razer, logitech). </li>
                        <li> We must also adapt this to our needs, we must not fall short or go too far. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> Features. </p>
                    <p> In case you want a mouse for gaming or activities that need speed: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> DPI or dots per inch, which allows us to see the resolution of the mouse. <br> We will be able to know how many pixels the mouse will move for each inch. </li>
                        <li> IPS or inches per second, which is the speed at which the mouse sensor can accurately track movement. </li>
                        <li> The number of buttons that we want our mouse to have in order to assign keys to them. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> There are many more variables (maximum acceleration, type of sensor ...) but having the two mentioned above controlled is enough. </p>
